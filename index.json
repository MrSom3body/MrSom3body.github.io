I\u0026rsquo;m currently studying network technology at the HTL Rennweg in Vienna, Austria.\nI\u0026rsquo;m quite passionate about technology, especially Linux and programming. Furthermore, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Linux and programming in Python since 2020. As expected, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot during this time, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share some of my experiences and thoughts with you. After starting at HTL Rennweg, I learned Java, networking, and many other things.\nSo, what can you expect from this blog? I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing about programming, Linux, and technology in general. It will be a mix of tutorials, guides, and personal experiences. Hopefully, there\u0026rsquo;s something for everyone, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner or an expert.\n","date":"14 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"about","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"14 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"projects","summary":"","title":"projects","type":"projects"},{"content":" professional experience üíº # Company Role Dates Hitachi Rail Internship: Software Tester July 2024 - August 2024 education üë®‚Äçüíª # School Branch Dates KLG\n(compulsory secondary school) science \u0026amp; mathematics 2017 - 2021 HTL Rennweg\n(higher technical vocational school) network technology 2021 - now certificates ‚úçÔ∏è # Certificate Institution Date EDLRIS - Artificial Intelligence Basic for Trainees OCG 29.03.2023 Crash Course on Python Coursera 05.05.2024 Using Python to Interact with the Operating System Coursera 13.09.2024 ","date":"14 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resume/","section":"","summary":"","title":"resume","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
