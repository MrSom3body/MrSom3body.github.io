I\u0026rsquo;m currently studying network technology at the HTL Rennweg in Vienna, Austria.\nI\u0026rsquo;m quite passionate about technology, especially Linux and programming. Furthermore, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Linux and programming in Python since 2020. As expected, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot during this time, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share some of my experiences and thoughts with you. After starting at HTL Rennweg, I learned Java, networking, and many other things.\nSo, what can you expect from this blog? I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing about programming, Linux, and technology in general. It will be a mix of tutorials, guides, and personal experiences. Hopefully, there\u0026rsquo;s something for everyone, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a beginner or an expert.\n","date":"14 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Some info about MrSom3body","title":"about","type":"page"},{"content":" nixos # These are my NixOS dotfiles.
