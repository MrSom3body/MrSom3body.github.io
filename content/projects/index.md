## nixos

These are my [NixOS](https://nixos.org) dotfiles. NixOS is a very different
kind of Linux distribution, but I'm too lazy to write an article about it
(yet), so here's a [quick introduction](https://youtu.be/FJVFXsNzYZQ) from
[Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship).

## vmware-installer

A project to make installing VMWare on Linux easier because it is such a PITA.
It will install VMWare Workstation for you (if it is not installed yet) and
also patch the VMWare Workstation modules which is the "difficult" part
automatically.
