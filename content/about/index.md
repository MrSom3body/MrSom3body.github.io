## Hello, world

I'm Karun, and I'm excited to welcome you to my blog. I'm currently studying network technology at the [HTL Rennweg](https://htl.rennweg.at/) in Vienna, Austria.

I'm quite passionate about technology, especially Linux and programming. Furthermore, I've been using **Linux** and programming in **Python** since 2020. As expected, I've learned a lot during this time, and I'm excited to share some of my experiences and thoughts with you. After starting at HTL Rennweg, I learned **Java**, **networking**, and many other things.

So, what can you expect from this blog? I'll be writing about programming, Linux, and technology in general. It will be a mix of tutorials, guides, and personal experiences. Hopefully, there's something for everyone, whether you're a beginner or an expert.
