I'm currently studying IT at the [HTL Rennweg](https://htl.rennweg.at/) in Austria (the land without kangaroos, btw). I’m a 17-year-old that loves tinkering with Linux, programming and doing fitness.

I have been programming in Python since I was 13 years old. Shortly after, I also switched to Linux because… yeah, why? I don’t really know, either, but anyway after I stopped feeling like a hacker every time I updated my system, I started to actually get to know Linux or more specifically Fedora. Now I’m constantly working on perfecting my setup, as you can see in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MrSom3body/dotfiles/).
