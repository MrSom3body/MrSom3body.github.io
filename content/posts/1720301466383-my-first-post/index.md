Hey!

Welcome to my blog! First of all, I should probably introduce myself (if you haven't already read my [about me](/about)). I'm Karun, a Linux enthusiast and a developer. I've been using Linux for a few years now and I've learned some things here and there. I've always wanted to share my experiences and knowledge with others, and that's why I decided to start this blog.

I'm kinda everywhere so there's no specific topic for this blog. I'll try to keep it mostly tech-related but I might post some random stuff too.
